### Welcome

Everything here is very much a work in process but in general,

Our aim is to build better iOS & macOS text views—that overcome the limitations of platform specific text views—for the display and editing of various markup formats that are easily embeddable in your app. 

**See our Super Swift Markdown libraries.**

Our current focus is building a better markdown preview for UIKit and AppKit with customizable text selection behavior and horizontally scrollable text fragments for non-wrappable markdown blocks (notably for displaying tables but also for fenced code blocks when such is preferred).

Contract us for licensing options or if you need custom solutions.
