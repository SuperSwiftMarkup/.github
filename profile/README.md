### Welcome

Everything here is very much a work in process but in general,

Our aim is to build better iOS & macOS text views that overcome the limitations of platform specific text views and that are easily embeddable in your app, for the display and editing of various markup formats.

**See our Super Swift Markdown libraries.**

Our current focus is building a better markdown preview for UIKit and AppKit with customizable text selection behavior and horizontally scrollable text fragments for non-wrappable markdown blocks (notably for displaying tables but also for fenced code blocks when such is preferred).

Contract us for licensing options or if you need custom solutions to your unique text related problems.
